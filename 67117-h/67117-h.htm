<p>To Cheselden has been conceded the honor of being
the father and originator of iridotomy. Nearly two
centuries have elapsed since he first published the report
of his procedure in the Philosophical Transactions for
1728. Ever since that time, his signal success has been
acknowledged by all except those who either failed to
equal his dexterity, or who were prejudiced by their
ambition to originate a new method.</p>

<p>A careful review of the medical literature of the century
and a half following Cheselden’s announcement
can not fail to impress the reader with the great interest
attached to operations for the formation of an artificial
pupil, which subject was considered second only in importance
to that of cataract itself. Not only were a large
number of monographs devoted wholly to this subject,
but every work on general surgical topics set aside one or
more chapters for the discussion of artificial pupil.
This is in great contrast to the limited space which modern
works on ophthalmology grudgingly yield to this still
important subject.</p>

<p>It is difficult for us to appreciate the conditions which
brought about so large a percentage of cases of pupillary
occlusion. Crude surgical procedures, poor operative
technic and the utter lack of asepsis often resulted
in iridocyclitis or iridochorioiditis. The couching of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
lens, the free discission of both hard and soft cataracts,
the frequent introduction of the knife-needle through
the dangerous ciliary zone, and the bungling efforts at
extraction all increased the tendency to inflammatory
reaction, while inadequate therapeutics and lack of
antiphlogistic measures frequently permitted the deposit
of plastic exudate in the pupillary area, thus resulting
in membranous occlusion of the pupil.</p>


<h2>OPERATIONS FOR ARTIFICIAL PUPIL.</h2>

<p>For the sake of historical completeness, and in order
to better emphasize the special domain of iridotomy, I
will mention briefly the various methods that have been
employed in making an artificial pupil. These are:</p>

<p>(1) <i>Division</i> of the thickened iris-membrane by an
incision made either through the sclerotica or through
the cornea. This is true <i>iridotomy</i>.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Excision</i> of a portion of the iris through a previously
made corneal opening. This is now known as
<i>iridectomy</i>.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Separation</i> of the iris from its ciliary attachment.
This was generally known as <i>iridodialysis</i>, but sometimes
called <i>iridorrhexis</i>.</p>

<p>(4) Simple <i>incision</i> of the pupillary margin, and of
the free iris tissue. This has been designated <i>sphincterotomy</i>
by some, and <i>coretomy</i> or <i>iritomy</i> by others.
Either one of the latter terms is to be preferred, because
it is more clearly descriptive.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Detachment</i> of the synechiæ at the pupillary
margin, either anterior or posterior, thus allowing the
pupil to retract. This was known as <i>corelysis</i>.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Strangulation</i> of the prolapsed iris in the corneal
incision was called <i>iridencleisis</i>. The prolapse was sometimes
tied with a ligature.</p>

<p>(7) <i>Trephining</i> of the iris-membrane, by passing a
small trephine or punch through a corneal incision.</p>

<p>(8) <i>Section</i> and removal of a portion of the sclerotica
and chorioid by knife or trephine, with replacement of
the conjunctiva over this opening, the conjunctiva thus
acting as a substitute for the cornea in transmitting
light. This was called <i>sclerectomy</i>.</p>

<p>(9) <i>Transplantation</i> of the cornea for total leucoma.
This was usually preceded by partial or complete trephining
of this membrane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span></p>

<p>In addition to these nine distinct methods certain
combinations of these have been described and successfully
practiced:</p>

<p>(10) <i>Division</i> and <i>excision</i> have frequently been performed
together.</p>

<p>(11) <i>Separation</i> and <i>excision</i> have likewise had some
vogue.</p>

<p>(12) <i>Separation</i> and <i>strangulation</i> have occasionally
been practiced.</p>

<p>(13) <i>Detachment</i> of the synechiæ and <i>excision</i> have
also been performed.</p>


<h2>HISTORICAL REVIEW OF IRIDOTOMY.</h2>

<p>In this brief review of iridotomy<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span> we shall confine
our attention to the methods that have been advanced
for the formation of an artificial pupil in cases of membranous
occlusion of the pupil following removal of the
lens, either by couching, extraction or discission, the iris-membrane
in these cases being chiefly composed of inflamed
iris tissue glued down by retro-iridian exudate
to the thickened lens capsule.</p>

<p>The early history of iridotomy shows that the advocates
of this operation were divided into two schools, (1)
those recommending the use of the <i>knife-needle</i> for incising
the iris-membrane, and (2) those adopting the
method of introducing <i>scissors</i> through a previously
made corneal section and freely incising the iris-membrane,
or excising a portion of the same. We will first
consider the school which advocated incision by the
knife-needle.</p>

<h2>I. KNIFE-NEEDLE METHOD.</h2>

<p>Cheselden<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span> a renowned surgeon, and oculist to Her
Majesty, Queen Caroline of England, first announced,
in 1728, his success in making an artificial pupil by
means of his knife-needle. He made his puncture
back of the corneoscleral junction on the temporal
side, passing the knife across the posterior chamber,
and making a counter-puncture in the iris-membrane
near the nasal margin. He then cut through the iris
from behind forward as he withdrew the knife, the
incision being carried through two-thirds of its extent.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
The pupillary opening thus made was a long
oval slit, horizontally placed. He has reported two successful
<span class="nowrap">cases<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span> (Figs.&nbsp;<a href="#i_07a">1</a> and 2), occurring in patients
who had previously undergone couching of the lens. His
instrument, strange to say, was practically of the same
general shape as the Hays knife-needle, but was larger,
and judging from the description more clumsily constructed,
as there was danger of leakage of the aqueous
and sometimes of the vitreous when it was used. Its
form resembled a combination of a bistoury and a sickle-shaped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
knife, having a sharp edge on one side, a rounded
back, and an acute point. We possess two good illustrations
of this knife-needle, one by Cheselden himself
(Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_07c">3</a>), and the other by his pupil, <span class="nowrap">Sharpe<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span> (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_25-1">4</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>For more than a century the method of Cheselden
seems to have been the storm center of controversy. Some
doubted his veracity, others essayed his operation but
failed, while a few had a moderate degree of success.
Many attributed to him statements which do not appear
in his published report. He says clearly that in each
of his cases couching had previously been performed,
and yet some have insisted that the lens was present, and
must have been wounded. He also states that his incision
was made from behind forward, and yet his followers,
<span class="nowrap">Sharpe<a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span> and Adams<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span> both describe the incision
as being made from before backward. As Sharpe was
his pupil, and presumably had seen him operate, <span class="nowrap">Guthrie<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span>
suggests the possibility of his having made his incision
both ways, the technic being practically the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

<p>Morand<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span> in his “Eulogy of Cheselden,” claims to have
personally seen him operate “on an eye in which the iris
was closed by an accident,” and gives a more detailed
description which closely follows the original method.
He states that Cheselden presented him with one of his
knife-needles as a souvenir of the occasion. Although
Morand does not record the exact date of his visit to
London, he does state that it occurred during the year
1729. Huguier<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span> in his exhaustive thesis on artificial
pupil, also places the date of this visit in the year 1729.
This fact is important, as some writers have declared
that Morand neither made the visit to London nor saw
Cheselden operate, but only quoted the original account
given in the Philosophical Transactions. The publication
of Morand’s high encomiums in 1757 attracted renewed
interest to the subject of Cheselden’s operation
among men of scientific and medical attainments.</p>

<p>Sharpe<span class="nowrap">,<a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span> in 1739, performed this operation in the
same manner as Cheselden, except that after he had
entered the knife-needle through the sclerotic he passed
it through the iris and across the anterior chamber,
and then incised the iris-membrane from before backward.
Although he was Cheselden’s pupil, and dedicated
his small volume on surgery to him, he probably
did his master more harm than good, as all the
objections to Cheselden’s method seemed to be based
on the deprecatory remarks of Sharpe. He says, “I
once performed it with tolerable success, and a few
months after, the very orifice I had made contracted and
brought on blindness again.” He mentions the danger
of wounding the lens, the lack of success in paralytic iris
with affection of the retina, the danger of iridodialysis
from traction of the knife, and the possibility of failure
because the incision would not enlarge sufficiently.
Thirty years later (1769) he published the ninth edition
of his book without recording a single additional
case, but added the thought that, since extraction of
the crystalline lens showed the cornea was not so vulnerable
as had been believed, he would “imagine” that
a larger knife might be introduced perpendicularly
through the cornea and iris and a similar incision
made. In his first eight editions he pictures Cheselden’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
iris-knife (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_25-1">4</a>, vide p.&nbsp;25), but in his ninth
edition he substitutes a broad lance-knife with two edges
which closely resembled the one Wenzel (vide Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_15">17</a>)
had just introduced (1767), and which Sharpe suggests
“can also be used for the extraction of the cataract.”
He evidently did not have a very clear idea of the subject,
and only succeeded in casting doubt and discredit
on the method of Cheselden, which, judging by his own
statement, he had tried but once.</p>

<p>Heuermann<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span> in 1756, had already antedated these
thoughts of Sharpe by practising a similar method. He
passed a double edged lance-knife through the cornea
instead of through the sclera, and then made a sweeping
incision through the iris-membrane without enlarging
the corneal wound. He was probably the first to puncture
the cornea with the iris-knife.</p>

<p>Janin<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span> about 1766, performed Cheselden’s operation
several times with but little success owing to reclosure
of the wound by plastic exudate. He adopted Sharpe’s
modification, but later on changed the incision from a
horizontal to a vertical one with better results. He, however,
afterward abandoned this procedure and became
the originator of the other school, composed of those
who preferred to use the scissors.</p>

<p>Guérin<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span> in 1769, made a free corneal incision with a
large cataract knife, and then introduced a small iris-knife,
with which he made a crucial incision from before
backward in the center of the iris-membrane. Although
<span class="nowrap">Guthrie<a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span> distinctly states that Guérin afterwards removed
the four angles of the cross with a pair of scissors
in order to prevent reclosure of the incision, no
direct confirmation of this statement can be found in
his writings.</p>

<p>Beer<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span> in 1792, first published his method, which he
designated as “an improvement on Cheselden’s method.”
Although the technic is somewhat different, the
procedure is practically the same as that originated by
Heuermann in 1756. Beer selected certain cases in
which a prolapsed iris had followed the lower incision
for cataract, causing adherent leucoma with a tensely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
drawn iris-membrane. He plunged his double-edged
lance-knife (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_25-9">5</a>) through the cornea and stretched
out iris, from above downward and a little obliquely
(Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_10">6</a>), so as to incise the center of the tense iris
fibers crosswise, at right angles to the line of traction;
cutting horizontally when the traction was vertical, and
vertically when this was horizontal. In his monograph
on artificial pupil<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span> 1805, he substitutes for the lance-knife
his new broad iris-knife, which is practically the
same as that later shown by Walton (vide Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_25-10">12</a>), as,
indeed, Walton’s procedure (vide Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_12">13</a>) was almost
identical with that of Beer. For other conditions he
usually employed Wenzel’s operation until by chance he
encountered a puzzling case which led him to perform
the operation we now know as iridectomy (1797) and
which thereafter became his favorite procedure for artificial
pupil.</p>

</div>

<p>Adams<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span> in 1812, revived the operation of Cheselden
with certain modifications. While his puncture was
made in the same location, his technic was different. He
entered the sclera with a small iris-<span class="nowrap">scalpel<a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor"></a></span> of his own
special design (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_25-7">7</a>), which, like Sharpe, he passed
through the iris-membrane into the anterior chamber,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
carrying it across to the nasal side (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_11a">8</a>). From entrance
to exit he always kept the edge of the knife
turned back toward the iris, so as to cut from before
backward. He was thus able by the most delicate pressure
of his instrument, to make a long horizontal incision,
without causing iridodialysis (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_11b">9</a>). If the first
incision appeared to be too short, he did not withdraw
the knife entirely, but again carried it forward and
partially withdrew it, always cutting in the same plane.
To quote his own words, “by repeating the efforts to
divide the iris (taking care in so doing to make as slight
a degree of pressure as possible upon the instrument, instead
of withdrawing it out of the eye at once, as recommended
by Cheselden), a division of that membrane
may, in almost all cases be effected, of a requisite size to
establish a permanent artificial pupil” (Figs.&nbsp;<a href="#i_11c">10</a> and
11).</p>

<p>Here were three elements of success, a sharp knife, a
gentle sawing movement, and the most delicate pressure
of the instrument. His method was a decided advance,
and he reported success in nearly one hundred cases.
Others, less skilful, however, failed of success, and the
severe criticisms of Scarpa<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span> though evidently unjust
and tinged by personal animosity<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span> cast a shadow of

</div>

<p>From that time on for nearly half a century this form
of iridotomy was practically abandoned, the pendulum
swinging toward the use of scissors, which Maunoir had
popularized and Scarpa had indorsed. Walton<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span> however,
about 1852, proposed a method closely resembling
that of Heuermann and almost identical with that of
Beer (vide Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_10">6</a>). His iris-knife (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_25-10">12</a>) was
practically the same as the broad iris-knife of Beer.
He incised the cornea near the limbus, and passed
the knife across the anterior chamber to the middle of
the iris-membrane which he punctured with a sweeping
vertical incision (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_12">13</a>). If the tissue still retained
its elasticity there appeared a long pupillary aperture,
elliptical and vertical (Figs.&nbsp;<a href="#i_13a">14</a> and 15). This incision,
however, like all those made through a single set of the
iris fibers, was only successful when there was sufficient
resiliency remaining in the iris tissue to draw the slit
open, and thus keep the edges from uniting. While
this method never became very popular, there were some
who later practiced it by substituting a very narrow
Graefe knife for the iris-knife of Heuermann, Beer and
Walton. In fact, this latter procedure still has considerable
vogue, both for iridotomy and capsulotomy.</p>

<p>During the following seventeen years no notable advance
was made, the scissors method still retaining its
hold on the profession, until in 1869, von Graefe, after
long reflection, became convinced of the dangers of that
method, and communicated to one of his pupils, M.
Meyer, his method of simple iridotomy performed with
the knife-needle. <span class="nowrap">Meyer<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span> quotes his views as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For such cases von Graefe has suggested another method of
operation, the principle and execution of which are contained in
the following note written for us by that illustrious savant in
1869:</p>

<p>“When, in consequence of a cataract operation, the lens is
absent, and when there is highly developed retro-iritic exudation,
with disorganization of the iris tissue, flattening of the
cornea and the other sequelæ of a destructive iridocyclitis, I
substitute simple iridotomy for iridectomy, which is the operation
hitherto performed, generally without success. The operation
consists in inserting a double-edged knife, resembling in
shape a very sharp pointed lance-knife, through the cornea and
newly formed tissues till it pierces the vitreous body, and immediately
withdrawing it; and, while withdrawing it, enlarging
the wound in the membranes without increasing the size
of the corneal wound. Experience shows that such plastic
membranes attached to the atrophied iris and to the capsule
of the lens have a tendency to contract sufficient to maintain,
to a certain extent, the opening which has been made.</p>

<p>“If, in the ordinary method of iridectomy, combined with
laceration or extraction of the false membranes, we find that
the artificial pupil usually becomes closed, we must attribute
this to an excessive vulnerability, which immediately sets up
proliferation in those tissues which have been touched, and
which are endowed, in consequence on their structure, with an
irritability altogether peculiar. We know that even the transitory
reduction of the intraocular pressure, which follows the
evacuation of the aqueous humor, is sufficient to give rise to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
hemorrhage in the anterior chamber, which interferes with the
perfect success of the intended operation; but most of our failures
in the ordinary methods are due to the irritation caused
by the forceps and the traction on the surrounding structures.
Simple iridotomy is free from such inconveniences; it is, so to
speak, a sub-corneal act, and enjoys the immunity which belongs
to subcutaneous operations.</p>

<p>“I have also reduced the corneal wound to a minimum, by
using small falciform knives. These are passed through the
false membranes, which are then cut from behind forward.”</p>
</div>

<p>Von Graefe thus proposed two methods, (1) by cutting
from before backward with a double-edged lance-knife,
according to the method of Heuermann, and (2) by
cutting from behind forward with a sickle-shaped knife,
after the original suggestion of Cheselden. Later in the
same year, as he lay on his last bed of illness, he became
so absorbed in the study of this subject that he sent a
telegram to the Heidelberg <span class="nowrap">Congress<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span> (September,
1869), in which he advocated the method by the sickle-shaped
knife-needle as the best procedure. His last message
to his colleagues showed, therefore, that through
mature conviction he strongly favored the use of the
knife-needle, and the making of a sub-corneal incision in
the iris-membrane without evacuating the aqueous humor.
His untimely death, however, prevented him from
further perfecting this procedure and presenting it to
the profession.</p>

<p>Galezowski<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span> in 1875, published a somewhat similar
method in which he used his falciform knife, <i>aiguille-a-serpette</i>
(Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_25-4">16</a>), which he introduced through the
cornea and iris-membrane, making either a horizontal
or a vertical incision, with a “go-and-come” (sawing)
movement, after the suggestion of Adams. If this
single cut was not sufficient, he made a linear incision of
the cornea with a Graefe knife, drew out the iris and cut
it off with scissors. By a process of evolution, however,
he perfected the former procedure and eliminated the
scissors. This latter method was published in the third
edition of his book in 1888. He punctured the cornea
and iris-membrane with the sickle-shaped knife, making
first a horizontal incision by the sawing movement of
Adams, and finishing with a second cut in the vertical
direction, thus forming a T-shaped incision. In actual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
practice, however, he almost always prolonged this second
cut, thus making a crucial incision after the manner
of Guérin<span class="nowrap">.<a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span></p>

<p>The writer<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></span> in 1888, was led to devise an operation
with a modified Hays knife-needle, in which through a
corneal puncture he made a converging incision in the
iris-membrane which resembled an inverted V. The resulting
pupil opened up and formed either a triangular
or an oval-shaped pupil depending on the degree of stiffness
or resiliency of the iris-membrane. This method
will be described in detail later on.</p>


<h2>II. SCISSORS METHOD.</h2>

<p>We will now return to the consideration of the second
school in which scissors were introduced through a previously
made corneal section and a free incision was made
in the iris-membrane, or a portion of the membrane excised.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_15" style="max-width: 15em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_15.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>Fig.&nbsp;17.&mdash;Wenzel’s cataract knife, and method
of incision (after Mackenzie).</p></div>
</div>

<p>Janin<span class="nowrap">,<a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span> in 1768, having abandoned the procedure of
Cheselden, proposed a new method. He incised the
cornea below as for cataract extraction, and raised the
corneal lip with a spatula while he introduced a pair of
curved scissors, the lower blade of which was pointed.
He plunged this sharp blade through the iris-membrane,
and with a single vertical cut made a crescentic pupil
which gaped sufficiently for visual purposes. As this is
the first known description of iridotomy by the scissors
method it is probable that Janin was the originator of
this procedure.</p>

<p>Wenzel<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></span> in 1786, employed a different method. With
a lance-shaped cataract knife he entered the cornea,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
dipped through the iris-membrane, returned to the anterior
chamber, and continuing to cut made a counter-puncture
on the opposite side of the cornea, following
which he completed his cataract incision. This gave a
semilunar flap of iris tissue which could easily be excised
by scissors passed through the large corneal opening
(Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_15">17</a>).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Maunoir<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></span> in 1802, took up the method of Janin,
with the object of improving it. He made an incision
near the corneal margin, through which he introduced
a pair of long, thin, angular scissors of his own design
(Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_16a">18</a>), one blade of which was sharp-pointed like a
lancet, and the other button-pointed like a probe. The
iris-membrane was then punctured by the sharp blade
at about the natural location of the pupil, and an incision
executed toward the ciliary margin of the iris.
Finding that this single incision did not always succeed<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span>
he subsequently improved this method by making
a second incision from the pupillary area toward the
iris margin, in the line of the radiating iris fibers, thus
making a divergent V (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_16b">19</a>). This triangular flap
was then allowed to shrink back, or if too stiff, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
drawn out and excised. The resultant pupil assumed
the shape either of a triangle, a parallelogram (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_16c">20</a>),
or a crescent (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_17">21</a>). He always made his incision
parallel with the radiating fibers of the iris and
across the circular fibers.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_17" style="max-width: 15em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_17.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>Fig.&nbsp;21.&mdash;Crescent pupil (Maunoir).</p></div>
</div>

<p>Scarpa<span class="nowrap">,<a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span> in 1818, having abandoned his own method
of iridodialysis as wholly unsatisfactory, adopted Maunoir’s
procedure with enthusiasm, chiefly because he had
by a friendly <span class="nowrap">correspondence<a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span> personally encouraged
Maunoir with advice and suggestion during its development.
He indorsed Maunoir’s plan of a double incision
when he stated his conviction that “experience has
proved that in order to obtain, with the most absolute
certainty, a <i>permanent</i> artificial pupil, it is necessary to
make <i>two</i> incisions in the iris so as to form a triangular
flap in the membrane, in the form of a letter V, the
apex being precisely in the center of the iris and the
base near the great margin.” Some have claimed that
Scarpa himself originated the V-shaped incision, but
he gives Maunoir full credit for its successful accomplishment,
although he does suggest some additional
indications for its practical application.</p>

<p>His opposition to the knife-needle incision of Cheselden
arose from the fact that the pupil either did not
open, or if it did open would not remain permanent,
chiefly because of the single iris incision. His antagonism
to the more successful procedure of Adams was the
result of a caustic personal <span class="nowrap">controversy<a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span> with that skilful
surgeon, who ably parried his charges<span class="nowrap">.<a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span> His great
influence with the profession of that day, however,
served to check the sentiment in favor of Adams’ procedure,
and when the weight of his indorsement was cast
in favor of Maunoir’s operation the scales were decisively
turned toward the side of the scissors method.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p>Mackenzie<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></span> in 1840, practiced Maunoir’s operation
with considerable success, but in certain cases found it
necessary to employ a slight modification of this procedure.
He reversed Maunoir’s incision by making the
same divergent V across the radiating fibers of the iris
instead of parallel with them (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_18a">22</a>), thus securing a
triangular pupil (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_18b">23</a>), which <span class="nowrap">Lawrence<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span> thought
might succeed in some cases where Maunoir’s method
would not be available.</p>

<p>Bowman<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></span> in 1872, proposed a method which, though
surgically difficult to execute, was quite ingenious, and
may have been the initial suggestion that stimulated
DeWecker to write his monograph in the following year.
I will quote his description as follows: “We make a
double opening simultaneously on opposite sides of the
cornea. It is more convenient, of course, to make these
two openings in a horizontal than in a vertical direction.
I then run a pair of scissors in two diverging lines (V)
from each incision, thus enclosing between the incisions
a large square or rhomboidal portion of the iridial region
including the pupil, and all the structures there. You
then withdraw the portion thus cut out. There is no
drag on the ciliary region; whatever is withdrawn has
been cut away from its connections beforehand” (Figs.
24, 25 and 26).</p>

<p>This method is simply an elaboration of the one proposed
by Maunoir, in which, instead of forming one divergent
V, Bowman has made a duplicate incision on the
opposite side, and by joining the bases of these two resultant
triangles has caused them to take the shape of a
rhomboid, thus &lt;&gt;.</p>

<p>DeWecker<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></span> in 1873, published his admirable monograph
on iridotomy, in which he proposed the operation
which bears his name, and which has long stood as the
best recognized method of this procedure. He advocated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
two different ways of performing this: 1, simple
iridotomy, and 2, double iridotomy.</p>

<p>1. <i>Simple Iridotomy.</i>&mdash;This is practically the same
operation as Critchett’s sphincterotomy and Bowman’s
visual iridotomy, although differently executed. It has
been supplanted in our day by iridectomy, and does not,
therefore, come within the purview of this discussion.</p>

<p>2. <i>Double Iridotomy.</i>&mdash;He rightly claimed that this
was both antiphlogistic and optical in its purpose. He
employed two distinct methods, which he designated as
(<i>a</i>) iritoectomie, and (<i>b</i>) iridodialysis. The instruments
he used were a small stop-keratome (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_19a">27</a>) and a pair
of specially devised fine iris scissors (pinces-ciseaux)
(Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_19b">28</a>), one blade being sharp pointed and the other
blunt. These scissors were a great mechanical advance
over all previous instruments of this kind, and undoubtedly
proved to be a most important element in the success
of his procedure.</p>

floated up against the knife, he pressed forward, making
a 2 millimeter incision in the iris. Slowly withdrawing
the knife, he introduced the sharp point of the scissors
through the iris buttonhole and cut obliquely from
either extremity of the incision toward the apex of a
triangle, thus making a convergent V (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_20a">29</a>). He
then grasped the resulting triangular flap with the forceps
and removed it, leaving an open central pupil.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Iridodialysis.</i>&mdash;His second method was a counterpart
of Maunoir’s earlier operation, with the addition
of iridodialysis. He made the corneal and iris incision
with the stop-knife, as in the previous method.
Slipping in his scissors he cut from the center of the
iris-membrane toward the periphery, and duplicated this
incision at an oblique angle to the first, thus making a
divergent V (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_20b">30</a>). This formed a triangular flap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
which he grasped with forceps and tore from its ciliary
attachment by iridodialysis.</p>

<p>DeWecker’s procedure was planned by a skilled operator,
and required great dexterity in its execution. When
successful, however, the result was most brilliant. Nevertheless,
it was impossible to eliminate the danger of
hemorrhage and loss of fluid vitreous in iritoectomie,
while in iridodialysis there was the added danger of a
torn ciliary surface and traction on the ciliary body. His
strict injunction to have a trained assistant hold up the
speculum blades in order to avoid the loss of fluid
vitreous, showed how much he feared this disastrous
contretemps. The success of his method of incision is
well shown in the illustration of his two cases (Figs.&nbsp;<a href="#i_21a">31</a>
and 32).</p>

</div>

<p>I have already suggested the possibility of Bowman’s
paper before the London Congress of 1872 having given
origin to DeWecker’s monograph in 1873. This seems
quite reasonable when we consider that Bowman proposed
two methods of iridotomy, one his double V operation
with a rhomboidal pupil (previously quoted), and
the other a visual iridotomy or sphincterotomy, by cutting
through the pupillary margin with a blunt corneal
knife. These two methods are exact prototypes of
DeWecker’s proposals. Furthermore, DeWecker was
present at the London Congress where he heard Bowman’s
paper, and took part in its discussion. In fact,
thirteen years later DeWecker <span class="nowrap">acknowledged<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></span> that after
considering the objections to Bowman’s method of iridotomy
“I addressed myself at that time to the search
for an instrument which allows the avoidance of all traction
on the iris, and which can be handled through a
narrow opening, while exerting its cutting action in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
plane parallel to the surface of the cornea, against which
the diaphragm of the iris applies itself, after the escape
of the aqueous humor. The forceps-scissors having been
discovered, it was easy for me to cause to be revived the
procedure of Janin, and to make it decisively take rank
in modern ocular surgery.”</p>

<p>DeWecker makes only a casual reference to Maunoir’s
method, but credits Janin with the original suggestion
of the method which he has thus elaborated. Nevertheless,
it is quite evident that DeWecker’s method was
simply a modification of the one outlined by Maunoir
seventy years before. Furthermore, he lays down the
same rule that Maunoir first offered: “Always cut parallel
to the radiating fibers and perpendicularly to the
circular fibers of the iris.”</p>


<h2>RELATIVE ADVANTAGES OF KNIFE-NEEDLE VS. SCISSORS.</h2>

<p>In reviewing the questions at issue between these two
schools of iridotomy, one can not help noticing the constant
oscillation from one method to the other as certain
advances were made. The method by the knife-needle
seemed to possess the advantage of easy accomplishment
and less postoperative disturbance, but with the disadvantage
that often the pupillary opening was inadequate
and promptly reclosed by plastic exudate. On the other
hand, the method by the scissors was more difficult of
accomplishment, caused more traumatism to the eye,
was often complicated by great loss of fluid vitreous, and
was frequently followed by severe inflammatory reaction.
If, however, it proved successful, the resulting
pupil was permanent and sufficiently large for visual
purposes. The inclination of all operators seemed to be
toward the use of the knife-needle, and it was only necessity
that forced them to adopt the more complicated
procedure of the open operation with scissors.
Von Graefe seemed to recognize this when he referred
to the knife-needle incision as “a sub-corneal act which
enjoys the immunity of subcutaneous operations.”</p>

<p>The chief advantages of iridotomy by the knife-needle
are the ease of incision, the lack of traction on
the ciliary body, the freedom from postoperative inflammatory
reaction, the avoidance of opening an eyeball
which may contain fluid vitreous, the lessening of the
tendency to iris hemorrhage from lowered tension, and
the avoidance of the nebulous scar which often follows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
a large corneal incision in old inflammatory eyes. The
disadvantages revealed in the method of the knife-needle
lay partly in the method and partly in the faulty instruments
constructed in that day. Cheselden, Morand,
Sharpe and Adams all made the mistake of entering the
eye back of the corneoscleral junction, which is so near
to the danger zone of the eye. Adams, however, made
a two-fold improvement in adding to his operation a
sawing movement and in advocating the “most delicate
pressure of the instrument” in order to make a free incision.
Heuermann was apparently the first to make
the puncture through the cornea instead of through the
sclera.</p>

<p>The advocates of the knife-needle method long labored
under the disadvantage of making a single iris incision,
while those who employed the scissors early discovered
that a double incision was necessary to success. Although
Janin was the originator of the scissors method, Maunoir
was the first to deliberately try a triangular flap, which
DeWecker later elaborated and made a permanent success.
The many disastrous results of the open operation,
however, compelled conservative surgeons, like von
Graefe, to revert to a study of Cheselden’s method, and
to seriously consider the great advantages which a successful
iridotomy by the knife-needle method would confer
on surgeon and patient alike.</p>


<h2>THE CHOICE OF A KNIFE-NEEDLE.</h2>

<p>1. Cheselden’s knife-needle (Figs.&nbsp;<a href="#i_07c">3</a> and <a href="#i_25-1">4</a>) was a
splendidly designed instrument, but a poorly executed
one. The blade was too large (11&nbsp;mm.) and the shank
improperly rounded, so that both aqueous and vitreous
were liable to escape through the scleral puncture. This
leakage may explain many failures, although the single
iris incision was undoubtedly the most serious fault of
the method.</p>

<p>2. The iris-scalpel of Adams (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_25-7">7</a>) was poorly designed
but splendidly executed, the long blade completely
filling the wound and thus preventing the escape
of any fluid. The cutting edge, however, was too
long (15 to 20&nbsp;mm.), and especially so for the execution
of the sawing movement advised by Adams.</p>

<p>3. The double-edged lance-knife (Figs.&nbsp;<a href="#i_25-9">5</a>, <a href="#i_25-10">12</a> and <a href="#i_25-8">33</a>)
employed by Heuermann, Beer and von Graefe, was useful
for the long sweeping incision in the iris-membrane<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
which they advocated, but is not adapted for the method
which will be described later. The same shaped knife
(Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_25-8">33</a>) with a smaller blade and a longer shank is
also used for this purpose, but is likewise too broad, too
oval pointed and too much bellied to cut well, while the
upper edge is liable to scarify Descemet’s membrane at
the same time that the lower edge is executing the incision
in the iris tissue.</p>

<p>4. The sickle-shaped knife (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_25-4">16</a>) which von
Graefe recommends and Galezowski employs, is excellent
for making the puncture, but for the go-and-come
movement, which Galezowski advises, is not nearly so
good as the straight blade with a slight falciform point.
It closely resembles the older falciform knife of Scarpa.</p>

<p>5. The knife-needle of Knapp (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_25-6">34</a>), which is so
generally used for capsulotomy, is unfortunately not well
adapted for iridotomy. The point is too oval, the cutting
edge is too much bellied, and the blade is too short
(5&nbsp;mm.). It will not easily puncture a dense iris-membrane,
and the long sawing incision can not be
well executed, because the short blade either persists in
slipping out of the iris incision or else allows the membrane
to ride up on the shank, in either case interfering
with the completion of the operation.</p>

<p>6. Sichel’s iridotome (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_25-5">35</a>) closely resembles
Knapp’s knife-needle, and although specially designed
for this purpose, has the same faults, an oval point and
a bellied edge. On the other hand, the blade is too long
(11&nbsp;mm.) to be easily manipulated in the anterior
chamber.</p>

<p>7. The Hays knife-needle (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_25-3">36</a>), as suggested in
the early part of this paper, has the same general shape
as Cheselden’s instrument, although much smaller. It
was devised by Dr. Isaac Hays, an early surgeon of the
Wills Hospital, and, although not well known to the
profession at large, has been in constant use by the
staff of that hospital for more than half a century. I
may be pardoned for briefly quoting the original description
of the instrument as published by <span class="nowrap">Hays<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></span> in
1855:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“This instrument from the point to the head, near the handle
(a to b, Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_25-3">36</a>), is six-tenths of an inch, its cutting edge
(a to c) is nearly four-tenths of an inch. The back is straight
to near the point, where it is truncated so as to make the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
point stronger, but at the same time leaving it very acute,
and the edge of this truncated portion of the back is made to
cut. The remainder of the back is simply rounded off. The
cutting edge is perfectly straight and is made to cut up to the
part where the instrument becomes round, c. This portion requires
to be carefully constructed, so that as the instrument
enters the eye it shall fill up the incision, and thus prevent the
escape of the aqueous humor.”</p>

<p>8. The knife-needle, which I invariably use, is a modified
pattern of that devised by Hays. The form of this
instrument lies midway between the falciform knife
and the bistoury, and possesses the advantages of both.
It has a very delicate point which punctures easily, and
an excellent cutting edge of sufficient length (7&nbsp;mm.).
If the shank is properly rounded it can be used with a
sawing motion, sliding backward and forward through
the corneal puncture without injuring the cornea, and
without allowing the aqueous to escape. To accomplish
this the more easily, the shank has been made 4&nbsp;mm.
longer than the original model. This instrument, therefore,
seems to meet all the requirements of a perfect
iris-knife, viz., a falciform point which makes the best
puncture, a straight edged blade which makes the best
incision, and a cutting edge 7&nbsp;mm. long, which is the best
length for properly executing the sawing movement. My
<span class="nowrap">model<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span> of knife-needle (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_25-2">37</a>) resembles Cheselden’s
knife, as shown by Sharpe (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_25-1">4</a>), even more closely
than the original pattern of Hays does.</p>

<h2>ESSENTIALS OF SUCCESS IN IRIDOTOMY BY THE KNIFE-NEEDLE
METHOD.</h2>

<p>1. A good knife-needle must be carefully selected.
We have already concluded that the modified Hays
knife-needle is the best model for this purpose. The
knife-needle must, of course, have a well sharpened
point and edge.</p>

<p>2. The character of the incision in the iris-membrane
is of vital importance. It should be a double incision.
Guérin, Maunoir, DeWecker and Galezowski recognized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
this. Guérin made a crucial incision, Maunoir and DeWecker
adopted the triangular flap, while Galezowski
advocated the T-shaped cut. Our choice is the V-shaped
incision, which is undoubtedly the only one that will cut
through all the iritic fibers in such a way as to give us
the greatest retraction of the membrane.</p>

<p>3. Absolutely no pressure should be made in cutting
with the knife-needle. This must be recognized as the
main secret of success, whether you are incising a dense,
felt-like iris-membrane, or a thin filmy capsule. If this
rule is observed all traction on the ciliary body will be
avoided.</p>

<p>4. The knife-needle should slide backward and forward
through the corneal puncture with a gentle sawing
movement.</p>

<p>5. The corneal puncture and membrane counter-puncture
should be far enough apart to make the corneal
puncture a good fulcrum for the delicate leverage necessary
in executing the iris incision.</p>

<p>6. The knife-needle should be so manipulated that no
aqueous shall be lost, as this accident may prevent the
completion of the operation, and may increase the tendency
to iris hemorrhage by lowering the ocular tension.</p>

<p>7. Every incision should be made a thoroughly clean
cut, and all tearing of the tissues should be avoided.</p>

<p>8. The most perfect artificial illumination should be
secured, either by an electric photophore or a condensing
lens, as both iridotomy and capsulotomy require constant
and close inspection of the operative field.</p>


<h2>AUTHOR’S V-SHAPED IRIDOTOMY.</h2>

<p>The method of V-shaped iridotomy, performed by me
with my modified Hays knife-needle, may be described
as follows:</p>

<p><i>First Stage.</i>&mdash;With the blade turned on the flat, the
knife-needle is entered at the corneo-scleral junction, or
through the upper part of the cornea (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_28a">38</a>), and
passed completely across the anterior chamber to within
3 <span class="nowrap">millimeters<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span> of the apparent iris periphery. The knife
is then turned edge downward, and carried 3 millimeters
to the left of the vertical plane (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_28b">39</a>).</p>

<p><i>Second Stage.</i>&mdash;The point is now allowed to rest on
the iris-membrane, and with a dart-like thrust the membrane<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
is pierced. Then without making pressure on the
tissue to be cut, the knife is drawn gently up and down
with a saw-like motion, until the incision has been carried
through the iris tissue from the point of the membrane
puncture to just beneath the point of the corneal
puncture. This movement is made wholly in a line with
the axis of the knife, the shank passing to and fro
through the corneal puncture, and the loss of any
aqueous being carefully avoided in the manipulation.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>Fig.&nbsp;41.&mdash;Pupil
re­sult­ing from V-shaped iridotomy.</p></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Third Stage.</i>&mdash;The pressure of the vitreous will now
cause the edges of the incision to immediately bulge
open into a long oval (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_28c">40</a>) through which the knife-blade
is raised upward, until above the iris-membrane,
and then swung across the anterior chamber to a corresponding
point on the right of the vertical plane,
which, owing to the disturbance in the relation of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
parts made by the first cut, is now somewhat displaced
and the second puncture must be made at least 1 millimeter
farther over, i. e., 4 millimeters to the right of
the vertical plane (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_28c">40</a>).</p>

<p><i>Fourth Stage.</i>&mdash;With the knife point again resting on
the membrane, a second puncture is made by the same
quick thrust, and the incision rapidly carried forward
by the sawing movement to meet the extremity of the
first incision, at the apex of the triangle, thus making
a <i>converging</i> V-shaped cut (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_28d">41</a>). Care must be
taken at this point that the pressure of the knife-edge on
the tissue shall be most gentle, and that the second incision
shall terminate a trifle inside the extremity of the
first, in order that the last fiber may be severed and thus
allow the apex of the flap to fall down behind the lower
part of the iris-membrane. If the flap does not roll
back of its own accord it may be pushed downward with
the point of the knife. When the operation is completed
the knife is again turned on the flat and quickly withdrawn.</p>


<h2>CAUSES OF FAILURE.</h2>

<p>The most fruitful sources of failure are, first, a poorly
sharpened knife-needle; second, a badly planned incision;
third, inability to sever the apex of the triangle;
fourth, the early loss of aqueous; fifth, too heavy pressure
with the knife-edge, and sixth, rocking or rotating
the knife backward instead of making the sawing movement.
All of these can easily be avoided, if the surgeon
will only exercise care and good judgment.</p>

<p>In an occasional case, the iris-membrane may be so
stiff that the apex of the flap will not retract. If the
apex can not be pushed down by the tip of the knife
turn the blade on the flat, puncture the base of the flap
by a quick thrust, and with a sawing motion cut across
its fibers so that it will fall back as though hinged; or,
if positive that the vitreous is not fluid, introduce a keratome
in the cornea below, draw out the triangular tongue,
cut it off with the iris scissors, and dress back the base
with a silver spatula.</p>

<p>It is possible that the capsule, or iris tissue, may lose
its anchorage. In that event we must either reverse the
procedure by entering the knife-needle below, and cut
from above downward, or else pass a second knife-needle
through the loosened edge of the membrane to fix it, and
then proceed with the usual method.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span></p>

<p>Occasionally, the apex of the triangular flap will hold
fast, because the last fiber of tissue has not been severed.
If the leverage is too short to incise it from above, withdraw
the knife-needle and reintroduce it far enough
from the apex to secure the proper leverage, and again
incise it gently, until it falls back.</p>

<p>Traction on the ciliary processes, accidental puncture
of the ciliary body, or the tearing of the membrane from
its ciliary attachment may all set up iridocyclitis or
glaucoma, and should therefore be avoided. As tense
capsular bands are liable to engender a similar condition
they should be incised. If any of these traction bands
should remain in the edge of the coloboma, we may enter
the knife behind them and gently saw through into the
already cleared pupil, before withdrawing the knife.</p>

<h2>ILLUSTRATIVE CASES.</h2>

<p>I will briefly cite a few examples of the V-shaped operation,
two that were my first efforts, and two that were
recent cases. They were all of the class that are often
abandoned as hopeless; hence the visual result is far below
the operative success.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Case 1.</span>&mdash;<i>History.</i>&mdash;F. M., aged 65 years. O.&nbsp;D. complete
membranous occlusion of pupil from iridocyclitis, following
cataract extraction. The iris and capsule are tensely drawn up
toward the ciliary border. Light perception and projection
good. Several efforts have been made to incise the membrane,
but without success. Admitted to Wills Hospital by the late
Dr. Goodman, through whose courtesy I operated.</p>

<p><i>Operation.</i>&mdash;On Jan. 15, 1889, I made two long incisions,
almost crucial, and extending beyond the apex of the V, resulting

Membranous occlusion of pupil. I first saw him in 1888 while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
house surgeon at the Wills Hospital, where iridotomy was skilfully
performed nine times by one of the surgeons, the methods
being varied and ingenious, but without success, as the incision
was invariably closed by plastic exudate. My interest
in this series of operations first drew my attention to the
subject of iridotomy, and stimulated me to develop the method
I have here submitted and which I first tried in Case 1.</p>

<p>One year later this patient came to my clinic at St. Joseph’s
Hospital. Iris was discolored, capsule thickened and visible
through the coloboma, down and in; areas of scleral thinning,
with pigmented chorioid showing through. T&mdash;3. Light perception
good, projection only fair.</p>

<p><i>Operation.</i>&mdash;On June 17, 1889, I made a V-shaped iridotomy
along the outlines of the former iridectomy. The membrane
freely opened up into a triangular or pear-shaped pupil (Fig.
43), which proved permanent, but was only useful for quantitative
vision, about 5/200. No further test could be made
because the disorganized vitreous was filled with floating
masses. I have seen him within a year, going about and earning
his living. From an operative standpoint I have always
considered this early effort one of my most successful cases,
chiefly because of the great density of the iris-membrane and
the lowered tension of the eyeball.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case 3.</span>&mdash;<i>History.</i>&mdash;Mrs. A.&nbsp;D., aged 45 years. O.&nbsp;D. iridectomy
for glaucoma seven years ago. O.&nbsp;S. iridectomy two years
ago by another surgeon, at which time there occurred slight
incarceration of iris, followed by sympathetic ophthalmitis in
O.&nbsp;D. The severe iridochorioiditis resulted in cataract and
some shrinkage of globe. The cataracts were extracted from
both eyes in 1907, followed by dense opacity of cornea above,
iris bombé, shallow anterior chamber, T&mdash;2. Here was a
soft, distensible, iris tissue with shallow anterior chamber and
greatly lowered tension of the eyeball, constituting one of the
most difficult conditions to operate on.</p>

<p><i>Operation.</i>&mdash;On May 13, 1907, the eyes being quiet, and
light perception and projection fair, V-shaped iridotomy was
performed on both eyes. The leucomatous areas in the upper
part of cornea necessitated making the pupil below. In O.&nbsp;D.
the pupil opened up beautifully (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_32a">44</a>), but in O.&nbsp;S. a tag<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
of iris hung fast (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_32b">45</a>) and was again incised two months
later. The artist has illustrated the remaining portion of this
tag very well. As soon as the iris tissue was incised it retracted,
making the pupils larger than the area of incision.
The test for glasses, nearly a year later, March 15, 1908,
yielded the following result:</p>

<p class="ml1em">
O. D. S + 13 D ⁐ C + 4.75 D ax. 105° = 20/40.<br />
O. D. S + 13 D ⁐ C + 3 D ax. 65° = 20/40.<br />
</p>

<p>Add</p>

<p class="ml1em">
O. D. S + 4 D = J. 10.<br />
O. S. S + 4 D = J. 10.<br />
</p>

<p>These were ordered in biconvex torics. She had worn glasses
for a year, but claims vision is much better with the new ones.
This seems like an excellent result when we consider that these
eyes had passed through glaucoma, iridochorioiditis and cataract,
followed by membranous occlusion of pupil, lowered tension
and fluid vitreous. The high hyperopia and astigmatism
show the phthisical condition of each globe. There is marked
cupping of both nerve heads and the fields are contracted.</p>

<h2>CAPSULOTOMY BY THE V-SHAPED METHOD.</h2>

<p>The application of the V-shaped method to capsulotomy
shows an even greater field of usefulness, as this
method is par excellence the best way of incising a delicate
secondary capsular cataract. This should be done
under artificial illumination. The pupil should be dilated,
as the area of incision is necessarily smaller than
in iridotomy, and unnecessary wounding of the iris
should be avoided. The proposed capsular opening must
be so calculated as to fall within the area of the undilated
pupil, or partly within the coloboma if an iridectomy
has been previously performed.</p>

<p>The knife-needle is entered at the upper corneal margin,
passed across the anterior chamber to a point 2&nbsp;mm.
to the left of the vertical plane (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_33c">48</a>), the capsule<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
punctured by a quick thrust, and the saw-like incision
carried from below upward, as in iridotomy. The knife
is then raised up above the capsule and swung 3&nbsp;mm.
to the right of the vertical plane (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_33d">49</a>), the capsule
is again punctured, and a duplicate incision carried up
to join the first, at the apex of the converging V (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#i_33e">50</a>).</p>

<p>Where the pupillary margin is adherent to the underlying
capsule, or the pupillary space is too small, it may
be necessary to start the incision in the iris tissue, a
little below the pupil, and then cut upward until the
knife emerges into the pupillary area, thus making an
irido-capsulotomy. The soft iris tissue is easily incised
if no pressure is made with the knife, and the sawing
motion is maintained.</p>


<h2>AFTER-TREATMENT.</h2>

<p>Postoperative inflammatory reaction is infrequent,
but if it should occur the usual antiphlogistic treatment
of atropin, calomel, ice-pads and leeching should be
actively instituted and continued until the eye is absolutely
quiet. The operation itself is frequently an antiphlogistic
measure, because it relieves iris-tension and
traction on the ciliary body. The usual compress of
gauze and cotton, covered with a Liebreich patch, may
be applied to the eye for the first twenty-four hours and
rest in bed enjoined for that period.</p>


<h2>IN CONCLUSION.</h2>

<p>We have carefully reviewed the history of iridotomy
for nearly two centuries, and noted how the pendulum
has swung from knife-needle to scissors, and back
again. We have learned that Cheselden, the father of
iridotomy, originated the method of incision by the
knife-needle, which Heuermann modified, and Adams
later revived and improved. We have seen how Janin
abandoned this procedure and originated the scissors
method, which Maunoir greatly improved and caused
to hold sway for more than half a century. We have
been deeply impressed by the fact that the mature, judicial
mind of von Graefe led him to abandon the scissors
and revert to the knife-needle method. We have
seen how, soon after his death, the great influence of De<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
Wecker had swerved the thought of the ophthalmic
world back to the adoption of the scissors method in a
greatly improved form.</p>

<p>Whether I have succeeded in citing sufficient facts
and arguments to establish my thesis in favor of the
knife-needle, or not, I nevertheless submit to the profession
my V-shaped method of iridotomy and capsulotomy
with a confidence born of twenty years’ successful
experience in its use, and with the hope that it
may prove equally efficient in the hands of others who
will take pains to study and understand the method, and
who may have the patience to put it in practice.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
